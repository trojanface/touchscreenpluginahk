# Touch Screen Plugin (AHK)
### By trojanface

## Description
This plugin enables customers to select their cinema seats from their side of the screen when using venuemaster. It accounts for two seperate screen sizes and scales the seat selection accurately from the customer facing screen to the cashier side. It also displays some custom GUI elements to further annotate the customer facing seat selection screen.

## Installation
1. These scripts require you to have Auto Hotkey Script installed.
2. These scripts require you to be using venuemaster software.

## Usage
1. Run the PluginSetup.ahk script first.
2. Select which cinema you're setting up.
3. Drag the three generated boxes over the blocks of seats you wish to scale from the customer side
to the cashier side.
4. Repeat the process for the blocks of seats on the cashier side.

5. Run TouchScreenPluginV1.2
6. If setup correctly a customer should be able to press on their touch screen and the mouse click
should be translated to the cashier side where it will then select the seat they wanted.
